The code is written to take the command line program that takes several CSV files as arguments. Each CSV file in the argument must have the same columns. 

The expected output is a combined output to stdout. Combined output also has one additional column that is the filename from which the data was parsed.
To run the code use reference below:

```
$ ./csv-combiner.py /Users/nehawakade/Desktop/accessories.csv /Users/nehawakade/Desktop/clothing.csv /Users/nehawakade/Desktop/household_cleaners.csv

```
